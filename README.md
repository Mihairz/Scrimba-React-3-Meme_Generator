## Meme generator
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>


This is the __third section's class project__ of Scrimba's React course. This section provided a lot of new key concepts, mainly focused about how *__**forms**__* are handled in React and about the *__**useState and useEffect hooks**__*. <br>
The app is connected to an API that provides top 100 memes image templates. The user can get a new image everytime a button is clicked. There are also 2 input fields that directly write on the image, one for the upper text and the other for the bottom text.
## First launch
1) `npm install`
2) `npm start`
   
App will run in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
